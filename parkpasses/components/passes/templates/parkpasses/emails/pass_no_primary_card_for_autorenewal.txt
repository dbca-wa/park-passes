            You have a {{pass.pass_type}} that is due to be renewed automatically on {{pass.date_expiry_formatted}}.

            Our system indicates that you do not currently have a primary card set up for this autorenewal.

            If you wish for this autorenewal to be successful, you will need to log in and set up a primary card.

            To update your credit card details please go to <a href="{{site_url}}{% url 'account' %}">{{site_url}}{% url 'account' %}</a>, log in and click on the 'Manage Cards' tab.

            Make sure there is at least one valid card on file and that it is selected as your primary card.

            If you do not want to renew your park pass, log in to your account at {{site_url}}{% url 'your-park-passes' %} and cancel the automatic renewal of your park pass.
